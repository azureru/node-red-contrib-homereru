# node-red-contrib-homereru

Collection of nodes for homeautomation and simple online asset health checking
Basically portion of this module is mish-mash from other nodes with some (subjective) adjustments
So it's usable for my small server + home automation use-case

The mish-mash since I cannot `inherit` the original module and do override, while
contributing PR to those module will kind of ruin their use-case
